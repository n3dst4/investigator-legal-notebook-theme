# Legal Notebook theme for INVESTIGATOR for Foundry VTT

A theme for [INVESTIGATOR][investigator], a [GUMSHOE SRD][gumshoe] compatible system for [Foundry VTT][fvtt].

Although this is a fully usable theme, the main intent here is to be an example of how to create a new theme in TypeScript. Themes for INVESTIGATOR are defined in code, but if you know CSS you'll see how it works.
